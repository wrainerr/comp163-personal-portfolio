 ## Description
 A Python program demonstrating how to organize and manage a student's personal, academic, and financial information using various Python data structures.

 ## Features
 - Strings (str): Used for storing individual pieces of text information like names, emails, majors, and hometown.

 - Lists (list): Used for ordered collections of items that can be changed (mutable), such as lists of courses or numerical data like credit hours and GPA.

 - Tuples (tuple): Used for ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collections of items, ideal for fixed data like contact information, addresses, or birthdays.

 - Sets (set): Used for unordered collections of unique items. This is great for tracking skills, interests, or hobbies where the order doesn't matter and duplicates are automatically removed.

 - Dictionaries (dict): Used for storing data in key-value pairs, which is perfect for mapping related information. For example, linking a course name (the key) to its professor, credits, or room number (the value).
